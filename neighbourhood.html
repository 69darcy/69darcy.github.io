                            <p>Our house is nestled away on a quiet residential street in downtown Toronto, just minutes away from bustling and vibrant areas like Chinatown, Kensington Market, and Queen Street West where you can get a sensory trip around the world! Our neighbours include families, working professionals, and students studying at the Unversity of Toronto, which is located just a 5 minute walk away. Just down the street from us is <a href="http://grangeparktoronto.ca/grange-park-today/">Grange Park</a>, a recently revitalized city park with a lush field and children's playground. The park is a great place to relax, read a book, toss a frisbee, or just get some fresh air. Beside the park is a community centre with a swimming pool, which is open to the public at certain times of the week. There are pharmacies, banks, supermarkets, restaurants, and all the amenities you can name within a 10 minute walk from our home. The neighbourhood is very safe at all times of day.</p>
